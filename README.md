# shipment_routing_app
This project develops an optimization algorithm for a parcel service's daily local deliveries in Salt Lake City, ensuring timely delivery of 40 unique packages under the constraint of less than 140 miles total traveled. This shipment routing application includes a text-based user interface (TUI). Detailed comments within the code provide insight into the decision-making process and algorithmic choices.
